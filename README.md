# Current weather and 5-Day Weather Forecast

A simple application to display current weather of user location and 5-day weather forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js 9.8.0 and above & expo

## Run

```
git clone
cd react-weather-forecast
npm i
```

## Start the dev server

```

npm run start

```

#### Notes:

- Running the build bundles all your updates to `bundle.js` and `bundle.css` in dist folder.
- If you insist to automate the build upon appending changes to files, use `webpack --watch`

## Test

```

npm run test

```

### TODOs

- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Identify and address edgecases.
- [ ] Use a proper loading spinner icon on page load.
- [ ] Consider day and night to display background of current weather section.
- [ ] Add an option to choose Units in either Metric or Imperial.
- [ ] Display higher-level of weather information such as Wind Speed, Precipitation etc
- [ ] Fix lint issues and config the eslintrc to support "no-vars-used" for Imports
- [ ] Better and more functional UI
